The goal of this program is to take a romlist file (generated by MAME32) and compare
its entries with the list of files provided by the rompath passed as the argument.
It then renames the .zip files in the rompath to the friendly names supplied by the list.

This program was written to provide a friendlier name to each rom file, because some
emulators (e.g., RetroArch) do not provide a UI that sorts out the ROM names into a
friendly list (like MAME32 does).

It is useless after all, because no emulator will play these renamed files.  :/
